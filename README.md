# AuthenticationPractice

For this project I am setting up users on PostgreSQL hashing passwords with bycrypt. Using routes to pass passport module using passport local strategy to authenticate users upon req on login submissions. Using express-session to maintain a state between backend to keep users logged in on new req or server crashes, enhancing security.

Using the req.user that is deserialized we can set is_admin or is_member properties for that user to true if the correct passwords are inputted, this taking advantage of express-session.

For my login and signup I am first validating input, while sanitizing with validation chain. In (config/passport.js) the authenticateUser function will express any errors from validation chain. If there are none, passport.authenticate local strategy proceeds.
NOTE: I could also use this function as a callback to the login to render out more error messages from local passport in future projects.

Run:
npm install express express-session pg passport passport-local ejs
-- installs all in one go for express session password encryption

npm install express-validator -- for sanitation and validation
npm install dotenv -- for storing secure user data in env file (put require('dotenv').config() in root file to enable access in .env file);

npm install bcryptjs -- for serializing passwords
npm install connect-pg-simple -- session storage (connecting db to session storage)
